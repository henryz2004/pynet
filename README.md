# PyNet

PyNet is a socket-based client/server network framework. Made entirely in Python, it is neither the fastest nor the most efficient such implementation. However, it still is a great choice for personal projects, not too slow, and easy to use. This framework has already been used in [PyTalk](https://github.com/henryz2004/pytalk), and is appropriate for a wide range of projects.

Features:
  1. Lightweight and extremely flexible
  2. No 3rd party dependencies
  3. Threaded client which allows for easy UIs
  4. Server-client communication is based on remote events, inspired by Roblox's protocol.
  5. Designed with security in mind (no injections)
  6. Easy to use
  
Todos:
  1. Concurrent server
  
If you want to learn how to use it, look at the server and client code for `PyTalk`. An official documentary is being worked on.
